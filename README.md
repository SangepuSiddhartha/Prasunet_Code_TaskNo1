# Caesar Cipher Python Program

This repository contains a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for both encryption and decryption. The program allows users to input a message and a shift value, and then either encrypt or decrypt the message based on the provided shift.

## Features

- Encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypt messages that were encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged during encryption and decryption.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-python.git
    cd caesar-cipher-python
    ```

2. **Run the program:**

    ```sh
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**

    - Choose option `1` to encrypt a message.
    - Enter the message you want to encrypt.
    - Enter a shift value (an integer) to shift each letter in the message.
    - The encrypted message will be displayed.

    - Choose option `2` to decrypt a message.
    - Enter the encrypted message.
    - Enter the original shift value used for encryption.
    - The decrypted message will be displayed.

    - Choose option `3` to exit the program.
